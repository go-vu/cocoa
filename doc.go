// Package cocoa provides functions and types that are shared between go-vu
// drivers for Apple platforms.
//
// The intent of this package is not to provide a full interface to the Cocoa
// framework in go but rather to share reusable code and expose convenient
// abstractions in the context of building OSX and iOS drivers for the go-vu
// project.
